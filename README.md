# Kaggle Bike Sharing Demand Competition

The Kaggle Bike Sharing Demand contest is a popular competition that challenges participants to predict bike rental demand based on historical usage patterns and weather data. This report provides a detailed walkthrough of a solution to this problem, explaining each process step. In this competition, participants are given historical data about bike rentals in a bikesharing system, including information about the date, time, weather conditions, and other factors. The goal is to predict the total number of bikes that will be rented during specific time periods in the test dataset.
